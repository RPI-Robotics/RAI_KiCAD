To allow the Schematic editor to have the library:


1.Copy the source files to the root of your KiCad project's folder. Make sure that the Arduino.pretty folder structure is preserved.

2.In Schematic Editor go to "Preferences" -> "Manage Symbol Libraries..." menu option.

3.In the Symbol Libraries dialogue that appears, switch to the "Project Specific Libraries" tab.

4.Click the + button where it says "Add empty row to table" when hovered.

5.In the new line of the table, set Library Path to "${KIPRJMOD}\arduino.kicad_sym" on Windows or 
"${KIPRJMOD}/arduino.kicad_sym" on Linux/Mac, and ensure Plugin Type is "KiCad".

6.Set Nickname to "Arduino_Library". You can leave the Options and Description fields blank.

7.Close the Symbol Libraries dialogue and you can find it as a library component.


To allow PCB files the same library:

(Same 1-3 & 5-7 step but in the PCB editor)

1.In PCB Editor go to "Preferences" -> "Manage Footprint Libraries..." menu option.

2.In the Footprint Libraries Libraries dialogue that appears, switch to the "Project Specific Libraries" tab.

3.Click the + button where it says "Add empty row to table" when hovered.

4.In the new line of the table, set Library Path to "${KIPRJMOD}\Arduino.pretty" on Windows 
or "${KIPRJMOD}/Arduino.pretty" on Linux/Mac, and ensure Plugin Type is "KiCad".

5.Set Nickname to "Arduino_Library". You can leave the Options and Description fields blank.

6.Close the Footprint Libraries dialogue and exit PCB Editor.

7.All done: you are now ready to use these schematic components and footprints!
